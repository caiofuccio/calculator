## Project Overview

I have created a calculator that can perform simple mathematical operations, one at a time, and return the result on the screen to the user. It can work with the four basic operations: add, subtract, multiply and divide. It can also works with floating point numbers.

Besides the numbers and operation buttons, it has an all-clear and a clear button, that can respectively clear the calculator display and clear the last digit.

The calculator display is divided in two parts: the upper one will show the previous operand or result and the operator, the bottom one will show the current operand. Once the user press the equal button or the enter key, the bottom half of the display will show the final result.

The operations are calculated one by one, but the user can continuously enter data, without the need of pressing equal every time.
